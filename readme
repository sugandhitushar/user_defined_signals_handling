NAME - Handling user defined signals

USAGE - 
$ make
$ make run

DESCRIPTION - 
Creates a child process using fork(). Prior to fork(), parent defines signal handlers for the user defined signals SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2.
Once fork() is completed, execl() creates an independent process and both the user defined signals are sent to parent where they are handled appropriately.

Example -
# make
gcc -o user_defined_signal_client user_defined_signal_client.c
gcc -o user_defined_signal user_defined_signal.c
# make run
./user_defined_signal
fork completed
user_defined_signal_client
Handled SIGUSR2(12) by process: 5812
Handled SIGUSR1(10) by process: 5812
Terminated child with pid=5813 and status=0
